    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>How does Focus Tree work?</h3>
    <p>Set a focus timer, put your phone down, and plant virtual trees while you study or work.</p>
    
    <h3>What happens if I break my focus?</h3>
    <p>If you exit the timer early, you'll lose the tree for that session.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I customize timer settings?</h3>
    <p>Go to Settings in the app to adjust timer lengths and notification preferences.</p>
    
    <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
    <p>Yes, all your focus data stays on your device. We don't collect personal information.</p>
